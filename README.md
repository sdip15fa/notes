# Notes
A simple React web app enabling notes sharing (not signed in) and saving (signed in).
## Deploy
```
yarn install //install packages
```
```
yarn run build //build the react web app
```
```
yarn run start //start the api server at localhost:4000
```
```
yarn run react-start //start the react web app at localhost:3000
```
## Reminders
idgenerator is hosted by cloudflare workers.
Don't forget to change api urls in src/ typescript files (it's fine if you use my api servers).
